PulseGhost is a predictive security agent that detects intrusions before they fully begin, by analyzing early attacker behaviour patterns-brute-force signals, command-history anamolies, sensitive file touches, and reconnaissance-level activity.

Built entirely with pure RHCSA-lvel Linux administration logic, pulseghost shows that powerful security doesn't need heavy agents, cloud, or AI models-just smart heuristics, clean engineering, and deep understanding of how attackers behave in real Linux environments.

pulseghost collects live stream signals, converts them into a unified threat score, and classifies activity into LOW,MEDIUM, OR HIGH RISK long before traditional tools would alert. Designed to be 100% lightweight, offline-first, auditable,and MSP -fiendly, pulseghost becomes the "silent guardian" layer of the pulsesuite ecosysytem -monitoring,analyzing, and predicting attacks without breaking performance or recquire external dependencies.

This tool demonstrates security thinking, system desig, automation mastery, and real linux engineering capability- all built with simple, elegant, and fully transparent bash logic.
